# Asset Example

This example demonstrates how you can upload your iOS Simulator build to Limrun Asset Storage
only once and have an iOS Simulator created with that app pre-installed or install it later
on-demand via `installApp` method.

Run the example:
```bash
export LIM_API_KEY=<lim token from Console>
yarn install
yarn run start

# Click on the instance link to connect!
```
