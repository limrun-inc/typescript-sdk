# Limrun React Components

`@limrun/ui` contains the React components needed to embed Limrun instances
in web applications. It exports `RemoteControl` plus accessibility snapshot
types and helpers for building inspect, search, and agent interfaces.

See [examples](../../examples/) to see how it can be used.

## Frameless embeds

`@limrun/ui` bundles Limrun's device frames and boot logos as inline images, about
600 KB. Embeds that render the bare screen can import `@limrun/ui/lite` instead: the same
`RemoteControl` API without any artwork, so `showFrame` has nothing to draw and the boot
logo is omitted. Pass your own images through the `assets` prop if you want frames back.

`onConnectionStateChange` reports `connecting`, `connected`, `reconnecting`, `failed`, and
`terminated` so a host can show status text without tracking the retry logic.

## Simulated cameras

`RemoteControl` responds automatically when an app in the instance opens,
closes, or switches a virtual camera. Camera facing is a preference: the
component requests the browser's `user` or `environment` camera with an
`ideal` constraint and falls back to an available input. Repeated requests for
the same facing reuse the live track. Facing changes restart capture so mobile
browsers can release one camera before opening the other.

WebRTC and the browser choose the capture resolution. The simulated camera's
host output follows the decoded frame dimensions, including width/height swaps
when captured video rotates. `onCameraDemandChange` receives fresh
`MediaStreamTrack.getSettings()` status metadata after track changes.

Camera API types (`CameraRequest`, `CameraResult`, `CameraFacingMode`,
`CameraCaptureInfo`, and `CameraStreamStats`) are exported from `@limrun/ui`.

Related browser workflow packages are published separately:

- `@limrun/apple-auth` handles Apple ID login, signing credentials, and App
  Store Connect.
- `@limrun/device-install` handles WebUSB pairing and real-device installation.
- `@limrun/play-auth` handles Google login and Google Play publishing.

## Releasing

This package is not part of generated SDK, hence you need to publish it manually in GitHub Actions.
